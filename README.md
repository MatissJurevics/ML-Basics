# Some basic projects that I made while learning more about machine learning, AI and neural networks.

This repo currently contains:
- A simple number classifier using the MNIST dataset. (There are three different models, two multiclass classifiers and one binary classifier using random forest.)
- A simple model trained on the titanic dataset.
